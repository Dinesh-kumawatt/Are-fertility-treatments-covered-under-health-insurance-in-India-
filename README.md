# Are-fertility-treatments-covered-under-health-insurance-in-India-

Until recently, most insurance policies in India did not cover fertility treatments, but this is slowly changing.

Now, some private insurance companies have started offering plans that cover:

IVF cycles (partially or fully)

IUI

Consultations and diagnostics

Hormone medicines

Surgery (if required before IVF like laparoscopy)

However, the coverage depends on:

Type of policy

Whether it's individual or employer-provided

Waiting period and age limit

How many IVF cycles are allowed

Itâ€™s always best to check with your insurance provider before starting IVF. Some policies require add-on maternity or special riders.
